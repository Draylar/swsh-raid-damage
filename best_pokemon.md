# Best Pokemon

What's the best Pokemon to run for raids? Some would suggest Eternatus or Zacian, while others might suggest a strong Dynamax. Let's compare results and see for ourselves!

### General
Any offensive Max Move that hits the enemy will remove 2 shields instead of 1. Effectiveness (-, +) and STAB don't impact shield breakage. Max Moves also increase the base power of regular moves, so this will be taken into consideration when doing calcs. The target has been selected to account for supereffective damage modifiers, and any supereffective move will be explicitly marked as one.

### Legendary Max Boost
Eternatus, Zacian, and Zamazenta all have special signature moves that do extra damage to Dynamax/Gigantamax Pokemon.

|   | Zacian | Zamazenta | Eternatus |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |--------- |
| **Type** | Steel  |   Steel   | Dragon |
| **Damage**  | 100  | 100 | 100 |
| **D-Max Damage**  | 200  | 200 | 200 |
| **Accuracy**  | 100%  | 100% | 100% |
| **PP**  | 5  | 5 | 5 |
| **Category** | Physical | Physical | Special |

Eternatus can learn Dynamax Cannon at level 56. When Zacian & Zamazenta have their items attached (Rusted Sword & Rusted Shield), and transform into Zacian-Crowned / Zamazenta-Crowned, the move Iron Head is replaced by their respective signature move. The move PP caps at 8 using [PP Ups](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/ppup.shtml) or [PP Max](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/ppmax.shtml).
