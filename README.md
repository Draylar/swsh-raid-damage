# SW&SH Max Raid Battles
*Max Raid Battles* are a new & fun mechanic in Pokemon: Sword and Shield. I couldn't find any detailed information on the entire system in one location, so I decided to do it myself.

Keys from images are marked by superscripted integers: example<sup>4</sup>. Example<sup>*</sup> refers to an entry in <Notes link>.

### Max Raid Overview
While exploring the wild area, you may stumble upon a stone circle-shaped structure. This is a raid den, and it's an entryway to a max raid battle. You can either find one randomly pre-activated, or you can activate it manually by interacting with it and giving it a wishing piece. Upon activation, the den stone will glow red, and a beam of light will shoot out of it:

### Den Tiers
Raid Dens have 2 different tiers: normal, which appears as the red beam pictured above, and rare, which is a purple beam surrounded by black spirals:

Rare (purple) beams have a 10% chance of spawning instead of a normal beam. These dens have different pools with rarer Pokemon and better item drops. To learn about resetting for rare dens, look at <Soft Resetting Dens link>.

### Den UI

When you interact with an activated den, you'll first get 2,000 watts, and then enter the den UI screen.

To the top left of the screen, the rarity of the den is shown<sup>1</sup>. This ranges from 1 to 5, and as you progress through the game, the average rarity of dens will go up. The number of stars impacts the Pokemon that spawns; this is described in depth in <Pokemon Spawns link>. Underneath the rarity is the type of the Pokemon that will spawn<sup>2</sup>, which is followed by it's shadow<sup>3</sup>. The current area weather is displayed in the bottom left<sup>4</sup>, and the den rules are described underneath that<sup>5</sup>. As of the end of 2019, all dens follow the same rule: you lose if **4** Pokemon on your side faint, or if the battle lasts for **10** turns. This is described in <Battle Mechanics link>.
  
The right side of the screen is where you can select different options. Hitting *Don't Invite Others*<sup>6</sup> will start the raid with NPCs. By clicking *Invite Others*<sup>7</sup>, you'll enter the following screen:

This page allows you to invite other players to the raid. If you enter on local communication, nobody will connect<sup>*1</sup>; you'll have to connect to the internet by pressing **+** in the Y-COMM (**Y**Y) to get random players. The top right of this screen shows the invitation time remaining<sup>1</sup>. The timer starts at 3:00 (3 minutes), and when it hits 0:00, the raid will start or cancel, depending on whether there are any players marked ready or not. Underneath this is the list of players participating alongside the Pokemon they've chosen. When a player hits *Ready to Battle!*<sup>1</sup>, a green checkmark appears next to their name:

If all 4 players have a green checkmark, the raid owner can hit *Start a Battle* to initiate the raid. After marking yourself as ready, you can only exit the raid by closing out of the game on your console. The battle will only cancel at 0:00 if you are the only person in queue and you haven't marked yourself as ready.

*Switch Pokemon*<sup>2</sup> brings you to a PC and allows you to change the Pokemon you are bringing to the raid. This option is disabled after you hit ready. *Quit*<sup>3</sup> will kick you from the queue and bring you back to the normal world; this option is also disabled after hitting ready. The first UI page with the *Invite Others* button has a *Switch Pokemon*<sup>8</sup> and *Quit*<sup>9</sup> as well. 

For information on battle mechanics after you enter the raid, see <Battle Mechanics link>.
  
### Soft Resetting Dens
When there are 100 dens in total, the chance of getting a rare beam at a specific den is next to zero, let alone with your desired Pokemon! Thankfully, there's an easy method of resetting for purple beams. To start, set your game text speed 1 setting lower than what you usually run with, for practice purposes. Grab a wishing piece and head over to your desired den. Save in front of it, and (don't do this yet), activate the den. About ~1 second after confirming the activation, press the home button on your Nintendo Switch. The den will start to glow, and a prompt about "Do not turn off the console!" will start to play. If the den isn't purple, turn off your console. Repeat this process until you get a purple den.

Several sources have suggested turning off auto-save for this process. This is not needed. Another rumor is that there is a potential for bricking your game: again, this is false. If anything *does* happen, the game already has a backup system that will fix the issue for you.
